	<chapter id="intro">Introduction</chapter>
	<p><strong>Anja</strong> is a sample player designed for live sound effect playback. Anja makes it possible to assign sound effects to the keys typing keys of the computer keyboard. To make it easier to find sound effects, each sound effect can have a description and a color, that shows up on Anja's virtual computer keyboard.</p>

	<p>Anja also featues a channel mixer with 16 channels. All sound effects are routed through one of these channels. The channel mixer makes it possible to fade a group of sound effects together. As with sound effects, each channel has a color and a description. In addition to color, description and channel gain, each channel also has an adjustable fade time, that is used to automatically fade the channel.</p>

	<p>The backend of Anja is JACK, the low-latency audio server<cite>jack</cite>. This makes it possible to connect Anja to other JACK clients enabling the creation of more complex signal flows.</p>

	<p>The session file format of Anja is in a formalized text format, optimized for human readability. The syntax of the session files has taken inspiration from formats such as Markdown<cite>markdown</cite> and is very similar to the syntax used in the "Doom template file"<cite>doomwiki</cite>. Therefore, session files can be easiliy edited by hand in a text editor, to the price of somewhat larger session files.</p>

	<section id="requirements">System requirements</section>
	<p>To run Anja, a working installation of JACK<cite>jack</cite> is required. Moreover, Anja requires <libname>libsndfile</libname> and <libname>GTK+</libname> version 3. Anja runs smoothly on an Intel® Pentium® M, and thus, it is only moderately CPU demanding. However, since Anja completely loads all sound files referenced from a session file, it may consume some RAM. At <quantity unit="kHz">48</quantity>, the RAM usage is <quantity unit="MiB/min">11</quantity> of sound. The minimum screen resolution for running Anja in fullscreen mode is <quantity unit="px">923</quantity> &#215; <quantity unit="px">599</quantity>. In windowed mode, the required screen resolution depends on the windowing system, but it is approximately <quantity unit="px">930</quantity> &#215; <quantity unit="px">630</quantity>.</p>


	<section id="comparison">Anja compared to other software</section>
	<p>There are other sample players that also may be used with JACK. One such program is Hydrogen<cite>hydrogen</cite>. Compared to Hydrogen, Anja lacks a sequencer. However, in Hydrogen, waveforms need to be assigned in a particular order, and Hydrogen does not feature an on-screen keyboard. Other features in Anja is event-triggerd auto-fade, and also a kill-all-softly feature.</p>

	<chapter id="install">Installing Anja</chapter>
	<p>Before Anja can be used, the program needs to be installed. This chapter goes through the installation procedure</p>

	<section id="installlinux">Installing on a GNU/Linux system</section>

	<p>On GNU/Linux, the recommended way of installing Anja is to download the source package<cite>anjasrc</cite>, and compile it. Assuming all dependencies are met, the following procedure in <ref what="Listing">installscript</ref> should work.</p>
	<listing language="bash" id="installscript">
		<caption>Installation script that can be used on a GNU/Linux system</caption>
		<code>#!/bin/bash
#This script downloads and compiles the latest Anja release

#Get the download URL
ANJA_SRC=`wget -q -O - https://api.github.com/repos/milasudril/anja/releases \
	| grep 'tarball_url' | head -n 1 | cut -d '"' -f 4`

#Download anja
wget -O anja.tar.gz "$ANJA_SRC"

#Extract the contents
SRC_DIR=`tar -xvf anja.tar.gz | head -n 1`

#Change directory
cd "$SRC_DIR"

#Complie
make</code>
</listing>
<p>When running <prgname>make</prgname>, files are written to <dirname>__wand_targets_rel</dirname>. After the compilation has completed, Anja can be launched directly as in <ref what="Listing">launch</ref>.</p>
	<listing language="bash" id="launch"><caption>Command to launch Anja</caption><code>__wand_targets_rel/anja</code>
	</listing>
	<p>To make it easier to launch Anja, you can move it to a place mentioned in the <env>PATH</env> variable. For example, if you have <prgname>sudo</prgname> permissions, you can do as in <ref what="Listing">linuxinstall</ref></p>
	<listing language="bash" id="linuxinstall"><caption>Command to "install" Anja</caption><code>sudo mv __wand_targets_rel/anja /usr/local/bin</code>
	</listing>

	<subsection id="deps">Obtaining all dependencies</subsection>
	<p>The procedure listed in <ref what="Listing">installscript</ref> assumed that all dependencies already are satisfied. On a Debian based system, all dependencies can be obtained by invoking the commands listed in <ref what="Listing">debs</ref>.</p>
	<listing language="bash" id="debs"><caption>Commands used to install all dependencies before compiling Anja on a Debian based system</caption><code>#!/bin/bash
#Install dependencies. These commands needs to be run before compiling Anja

sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
sudo apt-get install jackd
sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev</code>
