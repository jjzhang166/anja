	<chapter id="intro">Introduction</chapter>
	<p><strong>Anja</strong> is a sample player designed for live sound effect playback. Anja makes it possible to assign sound effects to the keys typing keys of the computer keyboard. To make it easier to find sound effects, each sound effect can have a description and a color, that shows up on Anja's virtual computer keyboard.</p>

	<p>Anja also featues a channel mixer with 16 channels. All sound effects are routed through one of these channels. The channel mixer makes it possible to fade a group of sound effects together. As with sound effects, each channel has a color and a description. In addition to color, description and channel gain, each channel also has an adjustable fade time, that is used to automatically fade the channel.</p>

	<p>The backend of Anja is JACK, the low-latency audio server<cite>jack</cite>. This makes it possible to connect Anja to other JACK clients enabling the creation of more complex signal flows.</p>

	<p>The session file format of Anja is in a formalized text format, optimized for human readability. The syntax of the session files has taken inspiration from formats such as Markdown<cite>markdown</cite> and is very similar to the syntax used in the "Doom template file"<cite>doomwiki</cite>. Therefore, session files can be easiliy edited by hand in a text editor, to the price of somewhat larger session files.</p>

	<section id="comparison">Anja compared to other software</section>
	<p>There are other sample players that also may be used with JACK. One such program is Hydrogen<cite>hydrogen</cite>. Compared to Hydrogen, Anja lacks a sequencer. However, in Hydrogen, waveforms need to be assigned in a particular order, and Hydrogen does not feature an on-screen keyboard. Other features in Anja is event-triggerd auto-fade, and also a kill-all-softly feature.</p>
