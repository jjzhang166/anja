Anja -- A sample player for Jack
================================
This project aims at building a live performance sample player/recorder for
Jack. In contrast to Hydrogen, this will feature a virtual keyboard display as
its main UI. Pre-recorded wave files can be associated to different keyboard
keys, and the virtual keyboard display will show labels for mapped keys, making
it easier to find the right sample during a live session. There will also be
a recording mode, so it is possible to record and playback.
