,"description":"A live sampler for use with JACK"

,"description_long":"Anja is a sample player designed for live sound effect playback. Anja makes it possible to assign sound effects to the keys of the computer keyboard. Anja also features a channel mixer with 16 channels, making it possible to fade a group of sound effects together, as well as MIDI capabilities, for remote control. The backend of Anja is JACK, the low-latency audio server."
